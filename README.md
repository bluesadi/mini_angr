# mini_angr

## Introduction
This is a simple imitation of [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) (an advanced symbolic execution engine).

## Why?
There are several reasons why I decided to develop this project:

1. For me and others to learn the methodology of symbolic execution better;
2. For me and others to learn the implementation of angr better;
3. Last but not least, for fun.
